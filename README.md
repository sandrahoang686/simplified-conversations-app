# SIMPLIFIED CONVERSATIONS APP

### An extremely stripped down conversations app

## Structure
* `api` is built with Express
* `simplifiedConversations` is a react-app

## Tech Stack and why I chose them
* React - Easily reuse components
* Typescript - Easy to type some of what the requirements were asking for and I like the documentation piece of TS
* Nodejs
* Express.js
* Redis
* Jest

## How to run locally
1. Follow the instructions in the `api` directory's README.md
2. Follow the instructions in the `simplifiedConversations` directory's README.md

## TODOs
There are still a few things that I wish I could've spent more time on, I've listed what I wish I could've spent more time on in each directory's README.md but the biggest ones are ... integration testing search (text distances).
